//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of 
// the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, 
// so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

var person1 = "\tAlbert Einstein\t";
console.log(person1);

console.log("\t"+person2+"\t\n"+person2);
console.log("\t"+person2);
console.log(person2+"\t;");
